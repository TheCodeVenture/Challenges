User should be able to see the details of hacker news stories (number of comments, score and creation date), when a user click on the comments counter those comments should be presented in the screen without forcing the user to leave the current page.
The list should have a mechanism to perform pagination of those stories.
When the user picks a story he should be redirected to that respective story url.
